INTRODUCTION                                  *github-complete.vim-introduction*


*github-complete* is a completion plugin to complete things related to GitHub.
It generates, caches and contextually shows candidates of completion via
GitHub API.
|github-complete| provides below completions.

- Emoji completion
- Issue completion
- User name completion
- Repository name completion


==============================================================================
INSTALL                                            *github-complete.vim-install*

If you don't use any plugin manager, copy all files in autoload/, plugin/ and
ftplugin/ to your .vim directory.

If you use a plugin manager, please follow the instruction of it to install
|github-complete|.

And then, some features are dependant on other plugins.  To use emoji
completion, please install vim-emoji in advance.  And to use asynchronous
communication with GitHub API, please install vimproc.vim in advance.

https://github.com/junegunn/vim-emoji
https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim

Note: They are optional.  No need to install them to use |github-complete| but
I recommend.

Below is an example for |neobundle.vim|.
>
    NeoBundle 'junegunn/vim-emoji'
    NeoBundle 'Shougo/vimproc.vim'
    NeoBundle 'rhysd/github-complete.vim'
<

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                *github-complete.vim-usage*

|github-complete| set 'omnifunc' when no other omnifunc is set on filetypes
"gitcommit" and "markdown".  In the case, you need not to setup any
configuration.  Otherwise, set "github_complete#complete" to 'omnifunc' in
your favorite filetypes in your |vimrc|.
Please be sure the proper 'omnifunc' is set with ":set omnifunc" in intended
filetypes.

>
    augroup config-github-complete
        autocmd!
        autocmd FileType gitcommit setl omnifunc=github_complete#complete
    augroup END
<
Now you can use contextual completions with <C-X><C-O>.  I'll show an example
use cases for each completion.
                                                               |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|

Note: "_" means the place of the cursor

EMOJI COMPLETION                    *github-complete.vim-usage-eomji-completion*

When the cursor is after ":", |github-complete| invokes emoji completion.
If your font can deal with unicode emojis, the items of completion show the
corrensponding emojis.

invokes GitHub repository completion.  It shows repositories which {user name}
owns.
